This project is a game where a player can play Connect 4 against the computer, which scans the board after each turn, calculates each possible move and subsequent responses, and determines what would be the next best move. They continue until one player wins or they tie. Moves are made by pressing the number corresponding with the column of the game scaffold, and “R” and “B” stand for Red or Black Player. 

The computer has a limited amount of time to make a move (within 15 seconds) and that move should give the best possible chances of the machine winning. There are three players: a HumanPlayer, a SmartPlayer (where the computer chooses the best possible move), and a BadPlayer (where the computer always chooses the leftmost column to place their token. A game can consist of two players from any of those three options, including a game where the computer plays itself.
